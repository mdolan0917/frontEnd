# frontEnd

I've been a backend developer for about 6 months in SalesForce but my overall goal is to be a full stack dev. So, I started going through The Odin Project to learn more about the frontEnd.

I have gone through probably a dozen courses and I think I always end up in the same place afterwards...a blank text editor, a blinking cursor, and thinking "did I even learn anything?!!?!". 

Usually that just leads me to take another course thinking that will be the solution to understand programming / development. 

But after working in this field for the past 6 months I finally realizes you just need to write code and a ton of it. Run into problem after problem and that is where you truly learn.

This repo will be my first front end project. I have no idea where I will start or where I will end but wish me luck.
